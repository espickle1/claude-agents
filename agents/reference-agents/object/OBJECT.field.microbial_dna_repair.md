# OBJECT.field.md — Microbial DNA Repair

## Field Identity

Primary discipline: Molecular microbiology
Subfield: DNA damage and repair mechanisms in bacteria
Specific focus: Discovery of novel DNA repair/protection proteins from phage and metagenomic sources

## Foundational Concepts

- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause DNA damage including strand breaks and nucleotide alterations
- RecA-dependent homologous recombination is a primary bacterial DNA repair mechanism
- Bacteriophages encode functional proteins that can complement or substitute for host functions

## Reference Ecosystem

Established knowledge base: ROS biology, canonical bacterial DNA repair pathways (RecA, RecBCD), E. coli genetics and mutant collections

Active frontier: Phage-derived proteins with novel functions, functional genomics screening of metagenomic libraries, structure-based function prediction for uncharacterized proteins

Adjacent fields: Structural biology, Bioinformatics, Phage therapy
