Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as cell signaling molecules for normal biologic processes. However, the generation of ROS can also provoke damage to multiple cellular organelles and processes, which can ultimately disrupt normal physiology. An imbalance between the production of ROS and the antioxidant defenses that protect cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, such as cancer, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and retinopathy. The nature of the injury will ultimately depend on specific molecular interactions, cellular locations, and timing of the insult. This review will outline the origins of endogenous and exogenously generated ROS. The molecular, cellular, pathologic, and physiologic targets will then be discussed with a particular emphasis on aspects relevant to child development. Finally, antioxidant defenses that scavenge ROS and mitigate associated toxicities will be presented, with a discussion of potential therapeutic approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of human diseases using enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.

Oxidative stress-the production and accumulation of reduced oxygen intermediates such as superoxide radicals, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals-can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA. Many disease processes of clinical interest and the aging process involve oxidative stress in their underlying etiology. The production of reactive oxygen species is also prevalent in the world's oceans, and oxidative stress is an important component of the stress response in marine organisms exposed to a variety of insults as a result of changes in environmental conditions such as thermal stress, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, or exposure to pollution. As in the clinical setting, reactive oxygen species are also important signal transduction molecules and mediators of damage in cellular processes, such as apoptosis and cell necrosis, for marine organisms. This review brings together the voluminous literature on the biochemistry and physiology of oxidative stress from the clinical and plant physiology disciplines with the fast-increasing interest in oxidative stress in marine environments.

Reactive oxygen species are a constant threat to DNA as they modify bases with the risk of disrupting genome function, inducing genome instability and mutation. Such risks are due to primary oxidative DNA damage and also mediated by the repair process. This leads to a delicate decision process for the cell as to whether to repair a damaged base at a specific genomic location or better leave it unrepaired. Persistent DNA damage can disrupt genome function, but on the other hand it can also contribute to gene regulation by serving as an epigenetic mark. When such processes are out of balance, pathophysiological conditions could get accelerated, because oxidative DNA damage and resulting mutagenic processes are tightly linked to ageing, inflammation, and the development of multiple age-related diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent technological advancements and novel data analysis strategies have revealed that oxidative DNA damage, its repair, and related mutations distribute heterogeneously over the genome at multiple levels of resolution. The involved mechanisms act in the context of genome sequence, in interaction with genome function and chromatin. This review addresses what we currently know about the genome distribution of oxidative DNA damage, repair intermediates, and mutations. It will specifically focus on the various methodologies to measure oxidative DNA damage distribution and discuss the mechanistic conclusions derived from the different approaches. It will also address the consequences of oxidative DNA damage, specifically how it gives rise to mutations, genome instability, and how it can act as an epigenetic mark.

Living organisms are continuously exposed to a myriad of DNA damaging agents that can impact health and modulate disease-states. However, robust DNA repair and damage-bypass mechanisms faithfully protect the DNA by either removing or tolerating the damage to ensure an overall survival. Deviations in this fine-tuning are known to destabilize cellular metabolic homeostasis, as exemplified in diverse cancers where disruption or deregulation of DNA repair pathways results in genome instability. Because routinely used biological, physical and chemical agents impact human health, testing their genotoxicity and regulating their use have become important. In this introductory review, we will delineate mechanisms of DNA damage and the counteracting repair/tolerance pathways to provide insights into the molecular basis of genotoxicity in cells that lays the foundation for subsequent articles in this issue.

In bacteria, the processing of double-strand DNA breaks is mediated by the RecBCD, AddAB and AdnAB complexes. These multisubunit helicase-nuclease machines resect the DNA ends and load RecA protein to initiate homologous recombination. Recent studies have revealed fascinating insights into the molecular mechanisms of this process and the evolution of these machines.

Global transcriptional profiling and large scale phenotypic studies have shown that eukaryotic cells mount a robust and complex response to damage. Further, systems biology approaches have employed powerful analytical methods to integrate global data sets with regulatory sequences, protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, which have led to the identification of large networked responses to damage. A number of groups have shown that damage responsive networks embrace groups of highly connected genes and proteins and have illustrated that multiple interconnected cellular pathways respond to damage and moreover, dictate viability post damage. This review highlights some of the global studies that examine cellular responses to damage, and proposes that we should be moving from pathways to networks, in order to gain better insight into cellular defense mechanisms.

### [7] The phage T4 DNA ligase mediates bacterial chromosome DSBs repair as single component non-homologous end joining.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal forms of DNA damage that is not efficiently repaired in prokaryotes. Certain microorganisms can handle chromosomal DSBs using the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) system and ultimately cause genome mutagenesis. Here, we demonstrated that Enterobacteria phage T4 DNA ligase alone is capable of mediating

- **Journal:** International journal of radiation biology (1991)

The bacterial enzyme PvuII, which generates blunt-ended DNA double-strand breaks, and T4 DNA ligase, which seals adjacent DNA fragments in coupling to ATP cleavage, were introduced in mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts using osmolytic shock of pinocytic vesicles. Cells were then assayed for their clonogenic ability. In agreement with previous studies by others, we find that the PvuII restriction endonuclease simulates ionizing radiation effects by causing a dose-dependent loss of reproductive capacity. Here we show that the concomitant treatment with DNA ligase considerably increases cell survival. Survival curves were shown to be dependent on the ligase enzyme dose and on ATP concentration in the hypertonic medium. We conclude that T4 DNA ligase is able to repair some of the potentially lethal damage produced by restriction endonucleases in eucaryotic cells.

Despite many efforts to understand and leverage the functional potential of environmental viromes, most bacteriophage genes are largely uncharacterized. To explore novel biology from uncultivated microbes like phages, metagenomics has emerged as a powerful tool to directly mine new genes without the need to culture the diverse microbiota and the viruses within. When a pure computational approach cannot infer gene function, it may be necessary to create a DNA library from environmental genomic DNA, followed by the screening of that library for a particular function. However, these screens are often initiated without a metagenomic analysis of the completed DNA library being reported. Here, we describe the construction and characterization of DNA libraries from a single cultured phage (ΦT4), five cultured

### [10] Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model.
- **PMID:** [36927031](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36927031/)

- **Journal:** Science (New York, N.Y.) (2023)

Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structure. We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.

### [11] DALI shines a light on remote homologs: One hundred discoveries.
- **PMID:** [36419248](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36419248/)
- **DOI:** [10.1002/pro.4519](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4519)
- **Journal:** Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society (2023)

Structural comparison reveals remote homology that often fails to be detected by sequence comparison. The DALI web server (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali) is a platform for structural analysis that provides database searches and interactive visualization, including structural alignments annotated with secondary structure, protein families and sequence logos, and 3D structure superimposition supported by color-coded sequence and structure conservation. Here, we are using DALI to mine the AlphaFold Database version 1, which increased the structural coverage of protein families by 20%. We found 100 remote homologous relationships hitherto unreported in the current reference database for protein domains, Pfam 35.0. In particular, we linked 35 domains of unknown function (DUFs) to the previously characterized families, generating a functional hypothesis that can be explored downstream in structural biology studies. Other findings include gene fusions, tandem duplications, and adjustments to domain boundaries. The evidence for homology can be browsed interactively through live examples on DALI's website.

### [12] Detection of DNA damage in prokaryotes by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling.
- **PMID:** [10698764](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10698764/)
- **DOI:** [10.1128/AEM.66.3.1001-1006.2000](https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.66.3.1001-1006.2000)
- **Journal:** Applied and environmental microbiology (2000)

Numerous agents can damage the DNA of prokaryotes in the environment (e.g., reactive oxygen species, irradiation, and secondary metabolites such as antibiotics, enzymes, starvation, etc.). The large number of potential DNA-damaging agents, as well as their diverse modes of action, precludes a simple test of DNA damage based on detection of nucleic acid breakdown products. In this study, free 3'-OH DNA ends, produced by either direct damage or excision DNA repair, were used to assess DNA damage. Terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) is a procedure in which 3'-OH DNA ends are enzymatically labeled with dUTP-fluorescein isothiocyanate using TdT. Cells labeled by this method can be detected using fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. TUNEL was used to measure hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii and the bacterium Escherichia coli. DNA repair systems were implicated in the hydrogen peroxide-dependent generation of 3'-OH DNA ends by the finding that the protein synthesis inhibitors chloramphenicol and diphtheria toxin blocked TUNEL labeling of E. coli and H. volcanii, respectively. DNA damage induced by UV light and bacteriophage infection was also measured using TUNEL. This methodology should be useful in applications where DNA damage and repair are of interest, including mutant screening and monitoring of DNA damage in the environment.

### [13] Substantial DNA damage from submicromolar intracellular hydrogen peroxide detected in Hpx- mutants of Escherichia coli.

Since the discovery of catalase, it has been postulated that aerobic organisms generate enough oxidants to threaten their own fitness and, in particular, their genetic stability. An alternative is that these enzymes exist to defend the cell against more-abundant oxidants imposed by external sources. These hypotheses were tested directly through study of Hpx- (katG katE ahpCF) mutants of Escherichia coli, which lack enzymes to scavenge hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These strains grew well in anaerobic medium but poorly when they were aerated. The Hpx- bacteria formed filaments and exhibited high rates of mutagenesis, both indicators of DNA damage. An additional recA mutation caused Hpx- cells to die rapidly upon aeration, even though the intracellular H2O2 was <1 microM. Spin-trap experiments detected substantial hydroxyl radicals, and cell-permeable iron chelators eliminated both the phenotypic defects and hydroxyl-radical formation, confirming that the Fenton reaction was responsible. An Hpx- oxyR strain exhibited even more DNA lesions than did the Hpx- mutant, indicating that the OxyR stress response induced protein(s) that suppressed DNA damage. One critical protein was Dps, an iron-sequestration protein, because Hpx- dps mutants exhibited sensitivity similar to that of the Hpx- oxyR mutant. These results reveal that aerobic E. coli generates sufficient H2O2 to create toxic levels of DNA damage. Scavenging enzymes and controls on free iron are required to avoid that fate. The rate constant of the Fenton reaction measured at physiological pH was much higher than under the acidic conditions that were used to determine the commonly cited value.

Proteins and nucleic acids are essential biological macromolecules for cell life. Indeed, interactions between proteins and DNA regulate many biological processes such as protein synthesis, signal transduction, DNA storage, or DNA replication and repair. Despite their importance, less than 4% of total structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) correspond to protein-DNA complexes, and very few computational methods are available to model their structure. We present here the pyDockDNA web server, which can successfully model a protein-DNA complex with a reasonable predictive success rate (as benchmarked on a standard dataset of protein-DNA complex structures, where DNA is in B-DNA conformation). The server implements the pyDockDNA program, as a module of pyDock suite, thus including third-party programs, modules, and previously developed tools, as well as new modules and parameters to handle the DNA properly. The user is asked to enter Protein Data Bank files for protein and DNA input structures (or suitable models) and select the chains to be docked. The server calculations are mainly divided into three steps: sampling by FTDOCK, scoring with new energy-based parameters and the possibility of applying external restraints. The user can select different options for these steps. The final output screen shows a 3D representation of the top 10 models and a table sorting the model according to the scoring function selected previously. All these output files can be downloaded, including the top 100 models predicted by pyDockDNA. The server can be freely accessed for academic use (https://model3dbio.csic.es/pydockdna).

### [15] A conserved signaling pathway activates bacterial CBASS immune signaling in response to DNA damage.
- **PMID:** [36156805](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36156805/)

- **Journal:** The EMBO journal (2022)

To protect themselves from the constant threat of bacteriophage (phage) infection, bacteria have evolved diverse immune systems including restriction-modification, CRISPR-Cas, and many others. Here, we describe the discovery of a two-protein transcriptional regulator module associated with hundreds of CBASS immune systems and demonstrate that this module drives the expression of its associated CBASS system in response to DNA damage. We show that the helix-turn-helix transcriptional repressor CapH binds the promoter region of its associated CBASS system to repress transcription until it is cleaved by the metallopeptidase CapP. CapP is activated in vitro by single-stranded DNA, and in cells by DNA-damaging drugs. Together, CapH and CapP drive increased expression of their associated CBASS system in response to DNA damage. We identify CapH- and CapP-related proteins associated with diverse known and putative bacterial immune systems including DISARM and Pycsar antiphage operons. Overall, our data highlight a mechanism by which bacterial immune systems can sense and respond to a universal signal of cell stress, potentially enabling multiple immune systems to mount a coordinated defensive response against an invading pathogen.

### [16] DRNApred, fast sequence-based method that accurately predicts and discriminates DNA- and RNA-binding residues.
- **PMID:** [28132027](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28132027/)
- **DOI:** [10.1093/nar/gkx059](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx059)
- **Journal:** Nucleic acids research (2017)

Protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions are part of many diverse and essential cellular functions and yet most of them remain to be discovered and characterized. Recent research shows that sequence-based predictors of DNA-binding residues accurately find these residues but also cross-predict many RNA-binding residues as DNA-binding, and vice versa. Most of these methods are also relatively slow, prohibiting applications on the whole-genome scale. We describe a novel sequence-based method, DRNApred, which accurately and in high-throughput predicts and discriminates between DNA- and RNA-binding residues. DRNApred was designed using a new dataset with both DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, regression that penalizes cross-predictions, and a novel two-layered architecture. DRNApred outperforms state-of-the-art predictors of DNA- or RNA-binding residues on a benchmark test dataset by substantially reducing the cross predictions and predicting arguably higher quality false positives that are located nearby the native binding residues. Moreover, it also more accurately predicts the DNA- and RNA-binding proteins. Application on the human proteome confirms that DRNApred reduces the cross predictions among the native nucleic acid binders. Also, novel putative DNA/RNA-binding proteins that it predicts share similar subcellular locations and residue charge profiles with the known native binding proteins. Webserver of DRNApred is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DRNApred/.

### [17] Genetic evidence that zinc is an essential co-factor in the DNA binding domain of GAL4 protein.
- **PMID:** [3299106](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3299106/)
- **DOI:** [10.1038/328353a0](https://doi.org/10.1038/328353a0)
- **Journal:** Nature (1987 Jul 23-29)

The 'cysteine-zinc DNA binding finger' is a recently identified sequence motif that is present in a wide variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins and is thought to be directly involved in DNA binding. It has been proposed that an essential component of this structure is a zinc ion bound between two pairs of cysteine residues. The GAL4-encoded protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which binds to DNA and activates the transcription of several genes, contains this sequence motif. Here I describe a gal4 mutant with an alteration in the cysteine-zinc DNA binding finger whose defect is corrected in vivo by high concentrations of ZnCl2. The DNA binding activity of the altered protein from this mutant is restored by ZnCl2 in vitro. This is evidence that the GAL4 protein indeed contains zinc ions essential for its DNA binding activity.

The gene katG, encoding catalase HPI of Escherichia coli, was sequenced, predicting a 726-amino-acid protein. The sequence was confirmed by identification of potential regulatory elements and amino acid sequencing of peptides. HPI shows no homology to other catalases. The distances between katG, metF, and ppc were defined.

Heme-containing catalase sequences from 20 different organisms representing prokaryotes, fungi, animals, and plants have been compiled for phylogenetic reconstruction. Phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis show that fungal and animal catalases can be derived from one ancestor, whereas bacterial catalases fail to form a monophyletic group. Plant catalases appear to form a second class of catalases that arose independently from a possible prokaryotic ancestor.

Mutation is the most powerful driver of change for life on Earth. Pathogenic bacteria utilize mutation as a means to survive strong live-die selective pressures generated by chemical antibiotics. As such, the traditional drug-making pipeline, characterized by significant financial and time investment, is insufficient to keep pace with the rapid evolution of bacterial resistance to structurally fixed and chemically unmalleable antibacterial compounds. In contrast, the genetic diversity and adaptive mutability of the bacteriophage can be leveraged to not only overcome resistance but also used for the development of enhanced traits that increase lytic potential and therapeutic efficacy in relevant host microenvironments. This is the fundamental premise behind Baylor College of Medicine's Tailored Antibacterials and Innovative Laboratories for Phage (Φ) Research (TAILΦR) initiative. In this perspective, we outline the concept, structure, and process behind TAILΦR's attempt to generate a personalized therapeutic phage that addresses the most clinically challenging of bacterial infections.

- **DOI:** [10.1038/msb4100050](https://doi.org/10.1038/msb4100050)
- **Journal:** Molecular systems biology (2006)

We have systematically made a set of precisely defined, single-gene deletions of all nonessential genes in Escherichia coli K-12. Open-reading frame coding regions were replaced with a kanamycin cassette flanked by FLP recognition target sites by using a one-step method for inactivation of chromosomal genes and primers designed to create in-frame deletions upon excision of the resistance cassette. Of 4288 genes targeted, mutants were obtained for 3985. To alleviate problems encountered in high-throughput studies, two independent mutants were saved for every deleted gene. These mutants-the 'Keio collection'-provide a new resource not only for systematic analyses of unknown gene functions and gene regulatory networks but also for genome-wide testing of mutational effects in a common strain background, E. coli K-12 BW25113. We were unable to disrupt 303 genes, including 37 of unknown function, which are candidates for essential genes. Distribution is being handled via GenoBase (http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/).
