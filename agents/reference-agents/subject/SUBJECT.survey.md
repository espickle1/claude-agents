# SUBJECT.survey.md

## Intent

Broad landscape mapping

## Reader Values

- Range of concepts and connections
- Methodological diversity
- How work fits within and across fields
- Entry points for further exploration
- Patterns and themes across references

## Reader Tolerates

- Less depth on any single point
- Incomplete mechanistic detail
- Brief treatment of complex topics

## Reader Does Not Want

- Narrow focus that excludes relevant connections
- Excessive detail on one subtopic at expense of breadth
- Missing the forest for the trees

## Runtime Specification (optional)

[Specify scope of interest, e.g., "Include connections to adjacent fields"]
