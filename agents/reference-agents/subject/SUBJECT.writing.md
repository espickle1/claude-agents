# SUBJECT.writing.md

## Intent

Inform reader's own writing on similar topic

## Reader Values

- Argument structure and rhetorical patterns
- How authors deploy references
- Novelty framing strategies
- Methods justification approaches
- Transferable models and templates

## Reader Tolerates

- Focus on form over content
- Less attention to specific findings
- Emphasis on "how they wrote it" over "what they found"

## Reader Does Not Want

- Pure content summary without structural insight
- Technical details not transferable to reader's writing
- Findings without context of how they're presented

## Runtime Specification (optional)

[Describe reader's writing context, e.g., "Writing methods for novel protein characterization"]
