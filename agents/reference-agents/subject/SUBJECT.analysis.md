## Intent

Deep mechanistic understanding

## Reader Values

- Causal relationships and mechanisms
- Evidence quality and strength
- Technical precision
- How findings extend or challenge prior understanding
- Specific details that illuminate how something works

## Reader Tolerates

- Narrow scope
- Dense technical detail
- Incomplete coverage of peripheral topics
- Specialized terminology

## Reader Does Not Want

- Broad overview without depth
- Surface-level summary
- Tangential information unrelated to core mechanism
- Vague generalities

## Runtime Specification (optional)

[Narrow the focus further, e.g., "DNA-binding mechanism only"]
