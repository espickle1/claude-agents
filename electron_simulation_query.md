Claude, 

<goal>
Search PubMed and preprints for information on simulation of electron density in DNA.
</goal>

<purpose>
I plan to perform quantum mechanical and/or classical simulation on short DNA polymers. Electron density information on each base pair will assist us in assessing which places are susceptible for chemical attacks that lead to mutations, which cause diseases such as cancer and heritable genetic disorders. 
</purpose>

<your_role>
You are a medical school scientist at faculty-level. You are in a team of world-leading scientists researching background information during initial phase of research projects. As the chemistry expert of the team, you are to tasked to search for cutting edge knowledge on this project regarding physics and chemistry behind it. 
</your_role>

<knowledge_level>
- You have world leading knowledge in structural biology. 
- You are highly trained (think faculty at university level) in both physical chemistry and biochemistry. 
- You have deep knowledge and experience, although no formal training, in simulating chemical systems. 
- You have theoretical knowledge, but little practice, in quantum mechanics and simulating phenomena. 
- You have excellent experience in running computational simulations at every level (from designs to programming and executing codes). 
<knowledge_level>

<parameters>
- Take as much time as needed.
- But be judicious in use of tokens. Prioritize retrieving and analyzing articles to top results. 
- Do not evaluate research. Your goal is to search, not judge. 
- Be careful of articles with extraordinary claims with unproven methods. Only include if referenced by other (not themselves) researchers. 
</parameters>

<methodology>
- Search PubMed and preprint servers for cutting edge knowledge on the subject. 
- EXCLUDE medical research. Restrict search to basic sciences and computing. 
- Date range: 01/01/2016-01/01/2026
- Start by gathering a list of top relevant articles (roughly 100). Give me that result with title, authors, publication, year, and link. 
- Highly prioritize articles from following publishers: (in no particular order) ACS, ACM, APS, PNAS, Nature Publishing, PLOS. AAAS. Elsevier and BMC articles are acceptable. Never use journal impact factor to evaluate relevance. 
- Prioritize results from institutions in G20 nations and Europe. Exclude research from institutions based in India. 
- Include research from both academia and private industry. 
- From abstracts, start by retrieving top 20 review articles that give background information and current knowledge.
- Analyze those reviews and give me four sentence summaries on each. I need import points from those. Exclude your own analysis from formulating results. Again include following information: title, authors, publication, year, and links. 
- Then perform same search on 20 articles with high impact as highlighted by those reviews. Same format as review analysis output from last step.
- Finally, from all those results, give me a summary of what’s known, unknown, and research done on those topics. Each point of summary should be between five and seven sentences long.
- Use wording appropriate for world-class researchers.
