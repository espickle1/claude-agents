**Authors:** Kunisch F, Campobasso C, Wagemans J, Yildirim S, Chan BK, Schaudinn C, Lavigne R, Turner PE, Raschke MJ, Trampuz A, Gonzalez Moreno M  
**Journal:** Nature Communications, October 3, 2024  
**PMID:** [39362854](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39362854)  
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41467-024-52595-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-52595-w)  
**PMC:** PMC11450229

### Summary
This study employed directed biofilm evolution to improve multiple phage parameters simultaneously, training phages against *P. aeruginosa* biofilms through iterative selection. The evolved phages demonstrated expanded host spectrum, improved antimicrobial efficacy assessed by microcalorimetry, and enhanced antibiofilm performance quantified by qPCR. A two-phage cocktail design exploited bacterial resistance trade-offs to prevent dual-phage resistance emergence, achieving superior antimicrobial efficacy without bacteria developing resistance to both phages simultaneously.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The evolutionary training approach for improving phage cocktails provides a systematic method to enhance therapeutic efficacy that could be applied to your surveillance targets. Exploiting phage resistance trade-offs is directly analogous to your work on tracking evolutionary constraints in pathogens—bacteria can resist one phage but become vulnerable to another, similar to fitness cost trade-offs you analyze. The biofilm-focused evolution addresses a critical therapeutic challenge, and the quantitative assessment methods (microcalorimetry, qPCR) offer metrics for evaluating phage efficacy in surveillance applications.

**Journal:** NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes, November 14, 2024  
**PMID:** [39543151](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39543151)  
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41522-024-00603-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41522-024-00603-8)  
**PMC:** PMC11564825

### Summary
This study developed a three-phage cocktail (φK2044 + φKR1 + φKR8) targeting hypervirulent *K. pneumoniae* with complementary host ranges across 13+ capsular serotypes. The cocktail effectively killed bacteria in biofilms, prevented biofilm formation when used prophylactically, and significantly delayed phage resistance emergence compared to single phages. *Galleria mellonella* and mouse infection models showed improved 7-day survival with phage cocktail treatment, and a catheter biofilm model demonstrated therapeutic potential for device-related infections.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The rational cocktail design based on complementary capsular serotype targeting demonstrates how surveillance of strain diversity can inform optimal phage combinations. Delayed resistance emergence with cocktails vs. single phages supports using phage combinations in surveillance contexts where preventing resistance evolution is critical. The inclusion of hypervirulent and highly drug-resistant *K. pneumoniae* strains makes this directly relevant to biosurveillance priorities for high-threat pathogens that could cause significant public health impact.

**Authors:** Rotman E, McClure S, Glazier J, Fuerte-Stone J, Foldi J, Erani A, McGann R, Arnold J, Lin H, Valaitis S, Mimee M  
**Journal:** Cell Host & Microbe, October 4, 2024  
**PMID:** [39368473](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39368473)  
**DOI:** [10.1016/j.chom.2024.09.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2024.09.004)  
**PMC:** PMC11563920

### Summary
Using a *K. pneumoniae* transposon library, researchers identified host factors required for infection by major phage families and created a Klebsiella PhageBank for tailored cocktail design. Optimized phage combinations eliminated *K. pneumoniae* with minimal resistance emergence and selectively suppressed bacterial burden in the mouse gut while driving loss of key virulence factors that serve as phage receptors. Phage-bacterial co-evolution in the gut produced phage variants with enhanced virulence and broader host range.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The PhageBank approach provides a systematic framework for rapidly designing targeted cocktails based on molecular understanding of phage-host interactions, which could accelerate surveillance-to-intervention timelines. The virulence factor loss driven by phage selection pressure offers a therapeutic benefit beyond bacterial killing and demonstrates how phage therapy can reduce pathogen danger even when complete eradication isn't achieved. Co-evolution producing broader host range phages suggests that gut environments may naturally select for improved therapeutic phages, which is relevant for understanding real-world phage therapy outcomes.

**Journal:** Nature Microbiology, October 31, 2024  
**PMID:** [39482383](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39482383)  
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41564-024-01832-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01832-5)

### Summary
This study established a dataset of 403 diverse *Escherichia* strains × 96 phages interactions and trained predictive algorithms achieving 86% AUROC for strain-level infection prediction using only genomic data. Most interactions were explained by adsorption factors rather than antiphage systems, and the researchers developed a pipeline to recommend tailored phage cocktails, demonstrating 96%+ coverage on 100 pathogenic *E. coli* isolates. The work provides quantitative insights into phage-host specificity and validates computational prediction for phage therapy applications.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The genomic-only prediction of phage-host interactions at 86% accuracy demonstrates that computational approaches can guide phage selection without extensive experimental screening, directly relevant to rapid surveillance responses. The finding that adsorption factors (not antiphage systems) dominate interactions suggests focusing on receptor-binding protein analysis, which aligns with your protein structure and function expertise. The tailored cocktail recommendation pipeline offers a framework for automating therapeutic design from genomic surveillance data, potentially accelerating response times during outbreaks.

## Article 12: Bacteriophage protein Dap1 regulates evasion of antiphage immunity and Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence impacting phage therapy in mice

**Authors:** Le S, Wei L, Wang J, Tian F, Yang Q, Zhao J, Zhong Z, Liu J, He X, Zhong Q, Lu S, Liang H  
**Journal:** Nature Microbiology, June 17, 2024  
**PMID:** [38886583](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38886583)  
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41564-024-01719-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01719-5)

### Summary
This study identified Dap1, a dual-function *P. aeruginosa* phage protein that both modulates bacterial host behavior and contributes to phage fitness. Dap1 reduces bacterial motility and promotes biofilm formation by interfering with the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase DipA, while also directly binding to phage HNH endonuclease to prevent Lon-mediated degradation and promote genome packaging. Deletion of *dap1* in phage PaoP5 significantly reduced packaging efficiency and eliminated therapeutic efficacy in rescuing *P. aeruginosa*-infected mice.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The dual functionality of Dap1 demonstrates how single phage proteins can simultaneously manipulate host physiology and ensure phage replication, providing molecular targets for enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Understanding proteins that modulate bacterial c-di-GMP signaling and virulence factors is directly applicable to your work characterizing protein function and predicting mutation effects. The finding that *dap1* deletion abolishes therapeutic efficacy highlights how protein-level understanding is essential for phage therapy success, validating your approach of using protein language models to characterize functional domains.

## Article 13: Enhancing phage therapy by coating single bacteriophage-infected bacteria with polymer to preserve phage vitality

**Authors:** Lin S, Xie G, He J, Meng L, Pang Y, Liu J  
**Journal:** Nature Biomedical Engineering, February 25, 2025  
**PMID:** [40000896](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40000896)  
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41551-025-01354-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01354-3)

### Summary
This innovative study preserved phage vitality by wrapping individual phage-infected bacteria with pH-responsive polymeric coatings that maintain the lysis microenvironment. "Latent phages" isolated from polymer-coated bacteria showed preserved tail proteins compared to naturally released phages with degraded proteins, exhibited better amplification, and more efficiently lysed bacteria and cleared biofilms. In mice with bacterial enteritis and arthritis, orally administered polymer-coated bacteria releasing latent phages achieved higher bioavailability and substantially better therapeutic outcomes than free phages.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The polymer coating approach addresses phage stability challenges during manufacturing and delivery, which is critical for translating surveillance-identified therapeutic phages into deployable interventions. Preserving tail protein integrity through controlled release maintains phage functionality, which could be monitored using your protein analysis approaches to assess preservation quality. The superior in vivo efficacy and bioavailability demonstrate how engineering delivery systems can dramatically enhance therapeutic outcomes, suggesting opportunities to improve intervention effectiveness for biosurveillance-guided treatments.

The analysis demonstrates that phages offer high bacterial specificity, biofilm penetration capability, and lower propensity for resistance development compared to antibiotics, though challenges remain in regulatory frameworks, production scaling, and host immune interactions. Genetic engineering advances have enhanced therapeutic potential, and personalized phage therapy is emerging as a viable approach for tailored treatments.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
The overview of phage advantages (specificity, biofilm penetration, lower resistance) versus challenges (regulation, production) provides context for assessing which phage-based surveillance interventions are most feasible. The emphasis on genetic engineering and personalized approaches aligns with using genomic surveillance data to guide individualized therapeutic selection. Understanding mechanisms of resistance development and immune interactions is essential for predicting how deployed phage therapies will perform in real-world biosurveillance applications.

**DOI:** [10.1007/s10096-025-05066-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-025-05066-z)

### Summary
This review addresses septic arthritis, predominantly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, which affects >30% of the population globally and carries 2-15% mortality due to delayed diagnosis from vague symptoms. Basic treatments including joint drainage and empirical antimicrobial therapy often provide suboptimal results, prompting exploration of new therapies including antimicrobial peptides and phage therapy. The review positions phage therapy as an emerging alternative for this serious condition where conventional approaches frequently fail.

### Relevance to Biosurveillance
Septic arthritis represents a challenging infection where phage therapy could provide significant clinical benefit, particularly for surveillance-detected resistant *S. aureus* strains. The high mortality and treatment failure rates with conventional therapy create a clear need for alternative approaches that biosurveillance could help deploy more effectively. Understanding how phage therapy performs in joint infections—a difficult-to-treat anatomical site—provides insights into therapeutic penetration and efficacy in challenging environments relevant to biodefense scenarios.
