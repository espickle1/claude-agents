## Article 1: Bacteriophage-mediated reduction of uropathogenic E. coli from the urogenital epithelium

**Authors:** Joshi B, Zulk JJ, Serchejian C, Hameed ZA, Larson AB, Terwilliger AL, Kumar D, Mysorekar IU, Britton RA, Maresso AW, Patras KA  
**Journal:** bioRxiv (Preprint), October 6, 2025  
**PMID:** [41279710](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41279710)  
**DOI:** [10.1101/2025.10.06.680661](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.06.680661)

### Summary

This comprehensive study evaluated lytic phage φHP3 and cocktail therapy for preventing UPEC colonization in urogenital tissues using in vitro epithelial cell models and in vivo humanized microbiota mice. The research demonstrated that phage pretreatment significantly reduced UPEC adhesion and invasion in vaginal and bladder epithelial cells, and intravaginal administration reduced vaginal bacterial burden by day 4 in mice. Live confocal microscopy confirmed direct phage-bacteria interactions with epithelial cells, while genomic analysis revealed phage-resistant strains were unaffected, confirming lytic activity as the primary mechanism. The study concludes phage therapy shows promise for UTI prevention by reducing urogenital UPEC colonization.

### Relevance

This work directly addresses a critical gap in UTI prevention by targeting the vaginal reservoir that contributes to recurrent infections. The multi-model approach (cell culture, live imaging, mouse model) parallels your systematic biosurveillance methodology of validating findings across complementary systems. The mechanistic insights into phage-epithelial interactions and resistance emergence patterns are particularly valuable for understanding evolutionary dynamics under therapeutic pressure, which aligns with your pandemic preparedness focus on tracking pathogen adaptation.

## Article 2: Human bladder organoids model urinary tract infection and bacteriophage therapy

**Authors:** Zulk JJ, Robertson CM, Ottinger S, Kambal A, Tostado AR, Fleck RC, Shea AE, Coarfa C, Blutt SE, Maresso AW, Patras KA  
**Journal:** bioRxiv (Preprint), July 30, 2025  
**PMID:** [40766562](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40766562)  
**DOI:** [10.1101/2025.07.30.667685](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.30.667685)

### Summary

Researchers developed human bladder organoids from multiple healthy donors that recapitulate the cellular diversity of the urothelium, creating a novel preclinical model for UTI and phage therapy research. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, they characterized organoid responses to UPEC infection and phage treatment both individually and in combination, finding that phage minimally affected uninfected uroepithelium but during active infection reduced bacterial burdens and dampened inflammatory responses and barrier disruption. The organoid system captures both conserved and individual-specific uroepithelial responses to infection while enabling preclinical efficacy and safety testing for therapeutic development.

### Relevance

This sophisticated organoid model represents a methodological breakthrough for testing phage therapies in a physiologically relevant system that maintains human tissue heterogeneity. The single-cell RNA-seq approach mirrors your use of computational tools to understand protein-level variation and could inform your surveillance work by revealing host response signatures to different therapeutic pressures. The multi-donor design addresses individual variation, which is crucial for understanding population-level pathogen evolution patterns and predicting which therapeutic approaches might drive concerning adaptive responses.

## Article 3: Results of TOR001: An open-label single patient study using targeted bacteriophage therapy for the treatment of chronic urinary tract infection

**Authors:** Cook JD, Hooey PB, Salazar KC, Clark JR, Jain U, Fernando C, Harvey H, Cervantes A, Omagari S, Blankstein U, Kropinski AM, Davidson AR, Maxwell KL, Burrows LL, Terwilliger AL, Maresso AW, German GJ  
**Journal:** International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, September 8, 2025, Volume 66, Issue 6, Pages 107613  
**PMID:** [40930191](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40930191)  
**DOI:** [10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2025.107613](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2025.107613)

### Summary

This clinical case report describes an open-label individual patient study using multi-route bacteriophage therapy (HP3.1, HP3, and ES19) for chronic UTI in a 72-year-old immunocompetent woman without urolithiasis or devices. The treatment protocol included bladder instillation, oral, and topical phage administration, with primary outcomes focused on safety and tolerability monitoring through daily symptom logs and laboratory analysis. While the treatment was safe with no serious adverse events, the patient experienced clinical relapse two weeks after initial improvement, requiring subsequent ertapenem antibiotic therapy for sustained cure. Whole genome sequencing of pre- and post-treatment isolates identified mutations in adhesion and evasion genes that may influence virulence and promote clearance.

### Relevance

This clinical trial provides real-world evidence of phage therapy safety in chronic UTI and demonstrates the importance of genomic surveillance for tracking bacterial evolution under therapeutic pressure. The identification of specific gene mutations in adhesion and evasion pathways exemplifies exactly the type of molecular-level adaptation monitoring central to your biosurveillance work. The combination therapy approach (phage followed by antibiotic) that achieved sustained cure suggests complementary treatment strategies could reduce selection pressure for dangerous resistance mutations, directly relevant to your pandemic preparedness focus on preventing emergence of highly adapted pathogens.
